The government is quite similar to many dystopian oligarchies. It is definitely fascist. Contraptions of mass surveillance, and mass media is very much active.

The government considers itself a *body* headed by a [[Entities/Literature/V for Vendetta/Characters/Adam James Susan\|supreme leader]] and consisting of various body parts like *fingers* (police), *ears, eyes, nose* (surveillance), and *voice* (propaganda). 

Another defining factor of the government is the [[Entities/Literature/V for Vendetta/Entities/Fate\|Fate]]. The AI that helps to run the show.
